| Directory | Comments |
| --------- | -------- |
| */* | The root directory, where everything begins.|
| */bin* | Contains binaries (programs) that must be present for the system to boot and run. |
| */boot* | Contains the Linux kernel, inital RAM disk image (for dirvers needed at boot time), and the boot loader. Interestin files include /boot/grub/grub.conf, or menu.lst, wich is used to configure the boot laoder, and /boot/vmlinuz (or something similiar), the Linux kernel. |
| */dev* | This is a special directory that contains *device nodes*. "Everything is a file" also applies to devices.  Here is where the kernel maintains a list of all the devices it understands. |
| */etc* | Contains all the system-wide configuration files. IT also contains a collection of shell scrits that start each of the system services at boot time.  Everything in this directory should be readable text.  While everything in */etc* is interesting, here are some all-time favorites: */etc/crontab*, a file that defines when automated jobs will run; */etc/fstab*, a table of storage devices and their associated mount points; and */etc/passwd*, a list of the user accounts. |
| */home* | in normal configurations, each user is given a directory in */home*. Ordinary sers can write files only in their home directories. This limitation protects the system from errant user activity. | 
| */lib* | Contains shared library files used by the core system programs. These are similar to dynamic link libraries (DLLs) in windows. |
| */lost+found* | Each formatted partition or device using a Linux file syste, such as xt3, will hav ethis directory. It is used in case of a partial recovery from a file system coruption event. Unless something really bad has happened to your system, this directory will remain empty. |
| */media* | On modern Linux systems, the /media dreictory will contain the mount points for removable media such as USB drives, CD-ROMs, and so on, that are mounted automatically at insertion.
| */mnt* | On older Linux systems, the */mnt* diretory contais mount points fro reovable devices that have been mounted manually. |
| */opt* | the */opt* directory is used ot install "optional" software. This is mainly used to hold commercial software products that might be installed on the system |
| */proc* | not a real file system in the sense o files stored on your hard drive.  Rather, it is a virtual file system maintained by the Linux kernel.  The "files" it contains are peepholes into the kernel itself. The files are readable and will give you a picture of how the kernel sees your computer. |
| */root* | This is the home directory for the root account |
| */sbin* | this direcotry contains "system" binlaries. These are programs that perform vital syste tasks that are generally reserved for the superuser |
| */tmp* | The /tmp directory is intended for the storage of temporary, transient files created by various programs. Some configurations cause this directory to be emptied each time the system is rebooted. |
| */usr* | The /usr directory tree is likely the largest one on a Linux system. It contains all the programs and support files used by regular users.|
| */usr/bin* | /usr/bin contains the executable programs installed by your Linux distribution. It is not uncommon for this directory to hold thousands of programs.|
| */usr/lib* | The shared libraries for the programs in /usr/bin. |
| */usr/local* | The /usr/local tree is where programs that are not included with your distribution but are intended for system-wide use are installed. Programs compiled from source code are normally installed in /usr/local/bin. On a newly installed Linux system, this tree exists, but it will be empty until the system administrator puts something in it. |
| */usr/share* | /usr/share contains all the shared data used by programs in /usr/bin. This includes things such as default configuration files, icons, screen backgrounds, sound files, and so on. |
| */usr/share/doc* | Most packages installed on the system will include some kind of documentation. In /usr/share/doc, we will find documentation files organized by package. |
| */var* | With the exception of /tmp and /home, the directories we have looked at so far remain relatively static; that is, their contents donâ€™t change. The /var directory tree is where data that is likely to change is stored. Various databases, spool files, user mail, and so forth, are located here. |
| */var/log* | /var/log contains log files, records of various system activity. These are important and should be monitored from time to time. The most useful ones are /var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog. Note that for security reasons on some systems, you must be the superuser to view log files.
